# Example Full Stack Application

This app shows a few parts of the XcooBee API and use of the XcooBee Payment SDK for JavaScript. It is based on Node Express Generator scaffolding and you  can deploy easily to review coding against what you need to do.

There are five tabs. Each tab corresponds to one area of the SDK or API and shows you how to code for it.

## Prerequisites

You will need a XcooBee account that you can use for development.
We recommend that you create a free Professional account since this will allow you to do coding with the Payment SDK and see full life cycle. When you use sandbox keys for Paypal or test keys for Stripe there will be no platform charges and you can develop you whole solution
before taking it into production easily.
